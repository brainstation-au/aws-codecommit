# AWS CodeCommit

Setup a local git repo with a CodeCommit remote, using AWS CLI.

Setup information is [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/setting-up-git-remote-codecommit.html#setting-up-git-remote-codecommit-connect-console).

The remote would look like one of the below:

1. `codecommit://MyDemoRepo`
1. `codecommit://AWSCLIProfile@MyDemoRepo`
1. `codecommit::ap-southeast-2://MyDemoRepo`
1. `codecommit::ap-southeast-2://AWSCLIProfile@MyDemoRepo`
